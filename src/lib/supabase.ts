// it is created using the createClient function from the @supabase/supabase-js library
// the createClient function takes two arguments: the supabase url and the supabase anon key
// the supabase url and anon key are stored in the .env.local file
// the supabase url and anon key are stored in the .env.local file
// the supabase url and anon key are stored in the .env.local file

// the next step is to create a supabase service role key
// the service role key is stored in the .env.local file
// the service role key is stored in the .env.local file
// the service role key is stored in the .env.local file

// the next step is to create a supabase service role key

// the service role key is stored in the .env.local file, we need the service role key to create a supabase client
